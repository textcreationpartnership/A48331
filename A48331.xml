            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

in the printing, as for materiall faults I know of none in the whole Work,
although I have diligently examined the printed ſheets.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:60174:7"/>In the following Treatiſe I have endeavoured to
proceed metho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dically, and to inſert every particular Chapter as it ought to
be read and practiſed, and have omitted nothing that might any way tend to
make a man in ſhort time become an exquiſite proficient in the
Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metricall part of Surveying.</p>
            <p>The firſt part of this Book conſiſteth of Geometry only, and
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth ſuch Problemes as are meet and neceſſary to be known and
practiſed by any man that intendeth to exerciſe himſelf in this
em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment: by help of theſe Problemes the plot of any piece of Land may be
inlarged or diminiſhed according to any aſſigned proportion, and
ſeparation and diviſion thereof made, if need be, by Rule and Compaſſe
only, and alſo by Arithmetick.</p>
            <p>In the ſecond Book, you have a generall deſcription of all the
moſt neceſſary Inſtruments uſed in Surveying, as of the
<hi>Theodolite, Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumferentor, Plain Table,</hi> and the like, and more
particularly of thoſe which I make uſe of in the proſecuting of this
diſcourſe. Alſo I have given ſuch directions for the making of the
<hi>Plain Table,</hi> and furniſhed the Index and other parts thereof with
diverſe neceſſary lines for ſeverall occaſions, ſo that it being
made according to the directions there given, it is the moſt abſolute and
univerſall Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment yet ever invented; for by it may be performed
whatſoever may be done by the <hi>Theodolite, Circumferentor,</hi> or
<hi>Peractor,</hi> with the ſame facility and exactneſſe, and in many
caſes better, as in the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular uſes thereof will plainly appear.</p>
            <p>The third Book is of <hi>Trigonometrie,</hi> or the Doctrine of
the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſion of Plain Triangles, by <hi>Sines, Tangents,</hi> and
<hi>Logarithms,</hi> by which the nature and reaſon of the taking of all
manner of Heights and Diſtances may the better appear, and for that reaſon
I have in this third Book added ſhort Tables of <hi>Sines</hi> and
<hi>Logarithms,</hi> name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Table of <hi>Sines</hi> to every 10 minutes of
the Quadrant, and a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of <hi>Logarithms</hi> from 1 to 1000, by which more
Queſtions may be reſolved in the ſpace of one houre, then by the uſuall
wayes taught by others can be performed in ſix, if the like exactneſſe be
required. And for a further abreviation of theſe Calculations, I have alſo
ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed how to reſolve all ſuch Caſes in Plain Triangles as may at any
time come in uſe in the practiſe of Surveying by the lines of Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
<hi>Numbers, Sines,</hi> and <hi>Tangents,</hi> whereby all ſuch Caſes may
be reſolved without pen, ink or paper.</p>
            <p>In the fourth Book is ſhewn the uſe of all the fore-mentioned
In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments in the practiſe of Surveying, and firſt, in the taking of
all manner of Heights and Diſtances either acceſſible or
inacceſſible, in the practiſe whereof the young practitioner will take
much delight, and receive no ſmall ſatisfaction.</p>
            <p>There is alſo taught how to take the plot of any field or other
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſure ſeverall wayes, both by the <hi>Plain Table, Theodolite</hi> and
<hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumferentor,</hi> by which will appear what congruity and harmony there
is between theſe ſeverall Inſtruments, for if you take the plot of any
field by any one of them, and then by another of them, and plot your work by
the ſame Scale as both your obſervations, you ſhall <pb facs="tcp:60174:7"/> (if you
be carefull) finde that theſe two Plots will agree together as exactly as if
they had been both taken by one and the ſame Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And for this
reaſon I have made one Scheme or figure ſerve for three ſeverall
Chapters, which hath much abreviated the number of Diagrams, and will (I
perſwade my ſelfe) give better ſatisfaction to the Learner, then variety
of figures could have done.</p>
            <p>In the manner of protracting, when you have reſerved your
degrees out by the Needle in the <hi>Circumferentor</hi> or the Index of the
<hi>Peractor,</hi> I have (becauſe the practiſe thereof is very uſuall
and no leſſe difficult) in <hi>pag</hi> 233 inſerted a figure ſo plain
and perſpicuous, that the very ſight thereof will be enough (if there were
no words uſed) to explain the uſe thereof.</p>
            <p>After the plot of any field is taken and protracted according to
any of the former directions, I come to ſhew how the content there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of may be
attained ſeverall wayes, that is, to finde how many Acres, Roods and Perches
are contained in any field thus plotted. Alſo there is taught how to

Topographicall Glaſſe of Maſter <hi>Arthur Hopton,</hi> with divers other
Inſtruments invented and publiſhed by <hi>Gemma Friſius, Orentius,
Clavius, Stofterus,</hi> and others; I ſhall immediately begin with the
deſcription of thoſe which are the ground and foundation of all the reſt,
and are now the only Inſtruments in moſt eſteem amongſt Surveyors, and
thoſe are chiefely theſe three, the Theodolite, the Circumferentor, and the
Plain Table. Now, as I would not confine any man to the uſe of one particular
Inſtrument for all employments, ſo I would adviſe any man not to cumber
himſelfe with multiplicity, ſince theſe three laſt named are
ſufficient for all occaſions. And if I ſhould confine any man to the
uſe of any one of theſe Inſtruments (as, for a ſhift, any one of them
will perform any kinde of work in Survey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) yet in that I ſhould do him
injury, for in many caſes one In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument may make a quicker diſpatch,
and be altogether as exact as another: As in laying down of a ſpacious
buſineſſe, I would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe <pb n="38" facs="tcp:60174:29"/> him to uſe the
Circumferentor or Theodolite, and for Town<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips and ſmall Incloſure the
Plain Table, ſo altering his Inſtrument according at the nature or quality
of the ground he is to meaſure doth require.</p>
               <p>Theſe three ſpeciall Inſtruments have been largely
deſcribed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready by divers, as namely, by Maſter <hi>Diggs,</hi> Maſter
<hi>Hopten,</hi> Maſter <hi>Rathborne,</hi> and laſt of all in
<hi>Planometria;</hi> yet in this place it will be very neceſſary to give a
particular deſcription of them again, becauſe if any man have a deſire to
any particular Inſtrument, he may give the better directions for the making
thereof.</p>
               <p>For the deſcription which I ſhall make of theſe three
Inſtruments in particular, it ſhall be agreeable to thoſe Inſtruments
as they are uſually made; with ſome ſmall addition or alteration: But
when I come to the deſcription of the Plain Table, after that I have
deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed it according to the vulgar way, I will then ſhew you a new
metamorphoſis of that Inſtrument, making it the moſt abſolute and
univerſall Inſtrument yet ever invented, ſo that having that one
Inſtrument (made according to the following directions) you ſhall have need
of no other for the due, exact, and ſpeedy performance of any thing belonging
to the Art of Surveying. 
<note place="margin">The Plain Table uſed as the
The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odolite.</note>For, the Frame of the Table being graduated according to
that deſcription, will be an abſolute Theodolite, and perform the work
thereof with the ſame facility and exactneſſe, and whatſoever may be
done by the limbe of the Theodolite, the ſame the degrees on the frame of the
Table will as well perform.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The Plain Table uſed as a
Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.</note>Likewiſe, the Index and Sights, together with the Box
and Needle, being taken from the Table, and ſcrewed to the Staffe (as in the
deſcription thereof it is ſo conveniently ordered) will be an abſolute
Circumferentor, and in ſome reſpects better then the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary one
hereafter deſcribed, becauſe the Sights thereof ſtand at a greater
diſtance, ſo that thereby the viſuall line may be the better
directed.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The plain Table, not one, but all
Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note>And this Inſtrument (as now contrived) though it be
called the Plain Table only, yet you ſee that it contains both the other, and
therefore in adviſing any man to the uſe thereof chiefely, I do not confine
him to one, but to all Inſtruments, and therefore do not contradict my former
expreſſion.</p>
               <p>Beſides, there is another great convenience which doth enſue
by the degrees on the Tables frame; for, in taking the plot of a field
according to the following directions by the Plain Table, you may at the ſame
time perform the ſame work by the degrees on the frame of the Table, if at
the drawing of every line you obſerve the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees cut by the Index, and note
them upon the paper. This I ſay is a great convenience, for at one
obſervation you perform two works with the ſame labour, as in the uſes of
theſe Inſtruments ſeverally will evidently appear. Many other
conveniencies will redound to a Surveyor by this contrivance, which with
ſmall practiſe will appear of themſelves.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Theodolite is an Inſtrument conſiſting of four parts
principally. The firſt whereof is a Circle divided into 360 equall parts,
called degrees, and each degree ſub-divided into as many other equall parts
as the largeneſſe of the Inſtrument will beſt permit: For the diameter
of this Circle, it may be of any length, but thoſe uſually made in
braſſe are about twelve or fourteen inches, and the limb thereof divided as
aforeſaid into 360 degrees, and ſub-divided into other parts by diagonall
lines drawn from the outmoſt and inmoſt concentrique Circles of the limb;
in the drawing of which concentrique Circles, they uſe to draw them
equidiſtant, which is erroneous, as ſhall appear hereafter.</p>
               <p>The ſecond part of this Inſtrument is the Geometricall
Square, which is deſcribed within the Circle, and the ſides thereof divided
into certain equall parts, but there are few of them made now with this Square,
for the degrees themſelves will better ſupply that want, it being only for
taking of heights and diſtances. Yet if any man be deſirous to have this
Square upon his Inſtrument, there is a more convenient way to ſet it on
then that which Maſter <hi>Diggs</hi> ſheweth, namely, upon the limb of the
Inſtrument, the manner how is well known to the Inſtrument maker.</p>
               <p>The third part of this Inſtrument is the Box and Needle, ſo
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently contrived to ſtand upon the center of the Circle, upon which
center alſo the Index of the Inſtrument muſt turn about; and ſomtimes
over the Box and Needle there is a Quadrant erected for the taking of heights
and diſtances.</p>
               <p>The fourth part of this Inſtrument is a Socket, to be
ſcrewed on the back ſide of the Inſtrument, to ſet it upon a ſtaffe
when you make uſe thereof. In the making of this Inſtrument, it were
ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to have two back Sights fixed at each end of one of the
Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ameters, for the readier laying out of any angle without moving of the
Inſtrument.</p>
               <p>Now, foraſmuch as in the dividing of the Degrees of any
Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference (as of a Quadrant, Theodolite, &amp;c.) into Minutes, they
uſually draw the concentrique Circles equidiſtant, which is falſe, as

length to the other, the longeſt containing about ſeven inches, being
placed and divided in all reſpects, as thoſe hereafter mentioned in the

performeth what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever may be done either by the <hi>Theodolite,
Circumferentor,</hi> or any other Inſtrument, with the ſame eaſe and
exactneſſe.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Table it ſelfe is a Parallelogram, containing in length
about fourteen inches and a halfe, and in bredth eleven inches: it is
compoſed of three ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall boards, which may be taken aſunder for eaſe
and convenience in carriage. For the binding of theſe three boards faſt
when the Table is ſet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, there belongeth a joynted frame, ſo
contrived, that it may be taken off, and put on the Table at pleaſure: this
frame alſo is to faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en a ſheet of paper upon the Table, when you are to
deſcribe the plot of any field, or other incloſure by the Table. This frame
muſt have upon it, neer the inward edge, Scales of equall parts on both
ſides, for the ſpeedy drawing of parallel lines upon the paper; and alſo
for the ſhifting of your paper, when one ſheet will not hold your whole
work.</p>
               <p>Unto this Table belongeth a Ruler or Index, containing in length
about ſixteen inches or more, it being full as long as from angle to angle of
your Table, it ought to be about two inches in bredth, and one third part of an
inch in thickneſſe. Upon this Ruler or Index two Sights muſt be placed;
one whereof is double in length to the other, the longer containing in length
about twelve inches, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſix: on the top of this ſhorter Sight is
placed a braſſe pin, and alſo a thred and plummet to place your
Inſtrument horizontall. Through the longer Sight muſt be made a ſlit,
almoſt the whole length thereof, Theſe two ſights thus prepared, are to
be perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicularly erected upon the Index; in ſuch ſort, that the Wyer on
the top of the ſhorter Sight, and the ſlit on the longer Sight ſtand
preciſely over the fiduciall edge of the Index. The ſpace or diſtance of
theſe two Sights one from the other, is to be equall to the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded part of
the longer Sight. Upon the longer Sight is to be pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced a Vane of braſſe,
to be moved up and down at pleaſure, through which a ſmall hole is to be
made, anſwerable to the ſlit in the ſame Sight, and the edge of the
Vane.</p>
               <p>By theſe Sights thus placed on the Index there is projected
the Geometricall Square, whoſe ſide is the divided part of the long 
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:60174:31"/> Sight (or the diſtance between the two Sights.) In the
middle of the long Sight (through the whole bredth thereof) there is drawn a
line called the line of Level, dividing the ſide of the projected Square into
two equall parts: alſo the ſame ſide is on this Sight divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a
hundred equall parts, which are numbered upwards and down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, from the line
of Levell, by fives and tens to fifty, on either ſide, which diviſions are
called the Scale.</p>
               <p>There is alſo on the ſame Sight another ſort of
diviſion, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting the hypothenuſall Lines of the ſame Square, as
they increaſe by Unites, and are likewiſe numbered upwards and downwards
from the line of Levell, from one to twelve, by 1, 2, 3, &amp;c. ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
ſignifying 101, 102, 103, &amp;c. theſe diviſions ſhew how much any
hypothenuſall or ſlope line drawn over the ſame Square, excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the
direct horizontall line, being the ſide of the ſame Square.</p>
               <p>On this Sight there is a third ſort of diviſions,
repreſenting the degrees of a Quadrant (or as many as the ſame ſight is
capaple to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, which are about 25) numbered from the line of Levell
up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and downward by fives and tens to 25, which diviſions are called the
Quadrant.</p>
               <p>Unto this Inſtrument, as unto all others belong theſe
neceſſary parts, as the Socket, the Staffe, the Box, and Needle,
&amp;c.</p>
               <p>¶ According to this deſcription, have Plain Tables
formerly been made, but if unto it be added theſe additionall parts and
alterations (which make it leſſe cumberſome then before) it will be the
moſt exact, abſolute and univerſall Inſtrument for a Surveyour that was
ever yet invented.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Let the frame be ſo fitted to the Table, that it may
go on eaſily either ſide being upwards; ſo that as one ſide is divided
into equall parts, (as in the deſcription) the other ſide may have
projected upon it the 180 degrees of a Semicircle, from a Center noted in the
ſuperficies of the Table, which degrees muſt be numbered from the left hand
towards the right (when the Center is next to you) by fives and tens to 180,
and then beginning again, ſet 190, and ſo ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively to 360.
Theſe degrees thus inſerted are of excellent uſe in wet or ſtormy
weather, when you cannot keep a ſheet of paper upon your Table, either in
reſpect of rain or winde. Alſo theſe degrees will make the Plain Table to
be an abſolute Theodolite, ſo that you may work with theſe degrees as if
they were the degrees of a The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odolite.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Upon the Index or Ruler before ſpoken of, (inſtead
of the Sights before deſcribed) let there be placed two Sights, both of one
length, and back-ſighted; one having a ſlit below, and a threed above; and
the other, a ſlit above, and a threed below, ſerving to look backward and
forward at pleaſure without turning about the Inſtrument, when the Needle
is at quiet. The expedition that theſe back-ſights will make, will beſt
appear by practiſe; for uſing theſe <pb n="44" facs="tcp:60174:32"/> you ſhall need
(in going about a field) to plant your Inſtrument but at every ſecond
angle.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, for the ready taking of heights, and the reducing of
Hypothenuſall to Horizontall lines (inſtead of the diviſions on the
Sights before mentioned) let there be projected a Tangent line along the ſide
of the Ruler, whoſe diviſions muſt touch the very edge thereof, ſo that
a Label or Ruler of Box or Braſſe, which is hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on a pin ſticking in
the ſide of one of the Back-ſights, and having another ſmall Sight at the
end thereof, may move juſtly along the ſide of the Index; then (the
Inſtrument ſtanding horizontall) if you look through this ſmall Sight,
and by the Pin on which the Label hangeth, moving the Label too and fro, till
you eſpie the mark you look at, then will the Labell ſhew you what Degree
of the Tangent line is cut thereby. This one line thus projected up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the
ſide of the Ruler performeth all the uſes of thoſe divided Sights, and is
far better, and leſſe cumberſome then them or a Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drant, (ſuch as I
formerly deſcribed in <hi>Planometria</hi>) becauſe the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees are
larger. This line of Tangents is projected on the Index from the foot of the
farthermoſt Sight, all along the Ruler to the foot of the nethermoſt Sight,
and up the ſide thereof and is numbred from 1 to 90, by 10, 20, 30, 40, 50,
&amp;c. ending at the foot of the furthermoſt Sight; from whence the line
proceeded.</p>
               <p>The uſe of this line of Tangents in taking of Heights is
ſhewed in the fourth Book, &amp; is uſed with the Tables of Sines and
Logarithms treated of in the third Book, without which Tables, (or ſomething
equivalent thereunto) this line of Tangents will be of little uſe, therefore
it will be convenient to have upon the Index of your Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the lines of
Artificiall Numbers, Sines, and Tangents, by which you may work any proportion
required very ſpeedily and exactly, ſo that if you be deſtitute of your
Tables, theſe Lines will ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently help you.</p>
               <p>There is yet another way by which you may take any altitude, or
reduce Hypothenuſall to Horizontall lines, only by Vulgar Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metick,
without the help of Tables, by having a line of equall parts divided on the
edge of the Index, and another line of the ſame equall parts on the Label, by
which lines, and Vulgar Arithmetick, an Altitude may very well be taken.</p>
               <p>Now becauſe I intend only to ſhew in generall the uſe of
theſe equall parts, I will therefore do it in this place, becauſe I ſhall
have occaſion to ſpeak no more thereof hereafter: The uſe thereof
(briefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) is thus.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>Now for the reducing of Hypothenuſall to Horizontall lines,
having meaſured the Hypothenuſall line with your Chain, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
will be: 
<list>
                     <item> As the equall parts cut on the Label,</item>
                     <item> Are to the equall parts cut on the Index;</item>
                     <item> So is the length of the Hypothenuſall line
meaſured,</item>
                     <item> To the length of the Horizontall line required.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>I thought good to give the Reader a view of the ſeverall wayes
there are to perform theſe concluſions, leaving every man at liberty to
uſe that which he beſt liketh, or all if he pleaſe, for all the lines may
very well be put upon one Inſtrument without any confuſion of lines: but
the way which I ſhall chiefly inſiſt upon in the proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting of this
Work, ſhall be by the line of Tangents, as being (in my opinion) the beſt
of all. Now when I come to ſhew you the uſe of this line of Tangents, with
the Tables of Sines and Logarithms in the reſolving of Triangles, I will
alſo ſhew you how to perform the ſame Propoſitions by the lines of
Artificiall Numbers, Sines, and Tangents, and therefore I would adviſe every
man to have theſe ſo neceſſary lines upon his Index.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Unto this Inſtrument alſo belongeth a Box and
Nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, which is to be faſtned to the ſide of the Table by help of two
ſcrews, ſo that it may be taken off and put on at pleaſure. In the
bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of this Box muſt be placed a Card divided into 360 degrees numbered
(if you pleaſe) after the uſuall manner, from the North Eaſtward, but the
Card by which all the Examples in this Book <pb n="46" facs="tcp:60174:33"/> were framed
was numbered from the North Weſtward by 10, 20, 30, &amp;c. to 360, contrary
to the common cuſtome.</p>
               <p>There belongeth alſo to this Inſtrument a Socket of
Braſſe to be ſcrewed on the back ſide of the Table, into which muſt
be put the head of the three legg'd Staffe; this Staffe ought to be joynted in
the middle, ſo that it may be the more portable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For the Socket, it may
be a plain one, but a Ball and Socket with an endleſſe ſcrew is the
beſt of all, for by help thereof you may place the Table (or any other
Inſtrument) either Horizontall, Verticall, or in any other poſition.</p>
               <p>¶ Note, that this Inſtrument (if made according to
theſe dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions) is the moſt abſolute Inſtrument for a Surveyor to
uſe.</p>

each link containing a Foot or 12 Inches, and ſo the whole Pole or Perch will

               <p>Some Chains have each Pole divided into 10 e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall parts, and

               <p>The Chains now uſed, and moſt eſteemed amongſt
Surveyors, are eſpecially two, namely, that generally uſed by Maſter

               </p>
               <p>Now becauſe theſe Chains are moſt eſteemed of and uſed

                  <p>THe Chain which Maſter <hi>Rathborne</hi> ordinarily uſed
(as himſelfe ſaith) contained in length two Statute Poles or Perches, each
Pole containing in length 16½ feet, which is 198 Inches, then each Pole
was divided into 10 equall parts called <hi>Primes,</hi> every of which
contained in length 19<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Inches;
again, every of thoſe Primes was ſub-divided into 10 other equall parts
called <hi>Seconds,</hi> ſo that every of theſe <hi>Seconds</hi> contained
in length 1 49/50 Inch, ſo that the whole Pole, Perch, Unite, or Commencement
(as he calleth it) was divided into 130 equall parts or Links, called
<hi>Seconds.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Chain (or one Pole thereof) being thus divided, at the end
of every 50 Links or halfe Pole, let a large Curtain ring be faſtned, 
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:60174:33"/> ſo ſhall you have in a whole Chain of two Perches
long, three of theſe Rings, the middlemoſt being the diviſion of the two
Poles. Then at the end of every <hi>Prime,</hi> that is, at the end of every
ten Links, let a ſmaller Curtain Ring be faſtened.</p>
                  <p>By this diſtinction of Rings, the Chain is divided into
theſe three denominations, <hi>Unites, Primes,</hi> and <hi>Seconds,</hi>
whoſe Characters are theſe, ◯ · ·, ſo that if you
would expreſſe 40 <hi>Unites,</hi> 8 <hi>Primes,</hi> and 7

you may perceive that thoſe Figures which have no pricks over them are
<hi>Unites</hi> or <hi>Intigers,</hi> and the figure under the firſt point
<hi>Primes,</hi> and under the next <hi>Seconds:</hi> ſo alſo, three
<hi>Unites,</hi> ſeven <hi>Primes,</hi> and two <hi>Seconds,</hi> will

                  <p>Beſides theſe diviſions, Maſter <hi>Rathborn</hi> for
his own uſe, ſewed at the end of every two <hi>Primes</hi> and a halfe
(which is a quarter of a Pole) a ſmall red cloth, and at every ſeven
<hi>Primes</hi> and a halfe (being three quarters of a Pole) the like of
yellow, or other diſcernable colour, which much helped him in the ready
reckoning of the ſeveral Rings upon the Chain, remembring this Rule: That if
it be the next Ring ſhort of the Red, it is two <hi>Primes,</hi> if the next
over three, if the next ſhort of the yellow, ſeven <hi>Primes;</hi> if the
next over eight; if the next ſhort of the great halfe Ring it is four, the
next over ſix: and if the next ſhort of the middle great Ring, it is nine,
and if the next over one.</p>
                  <p>¶ But here is to be noted, that if you uſe this
diſtinction by co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, you muſt alwayes work with one end of the Chain
from you.</p>
                  <p>This Chain being thus divided and marked, you have every whole
Pole equall to ten <hi>Primes,</hi> or 100 <hi>Seconds:</hi> every three
quarters of a Pole, equall to ſeven <hi>Primes</hi> and a halfe, or 75
<hi>Seconds:</hi> every halfe Pole equall to five <hi>Primes,</hi> or 50

                  </p>
                  <p>And here is to be noted, that in the ordinary uſe of this
Chain, for meaſuring and platting, you need take notice only of
<hi>Unites</hi> and <hi>Primes,</hi> which is exact enough for ordinary uſe,
but in caſe that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration or diviſion of Lands into ſeverall parts,
you may make uſe of <hi>Seconds.</hi>

                  <p>AS every Pole of Maſter <hi>Rathborns</hi> Chain was divided
into 100 Links, ſo Maſter <hi>Gunters</hi> whole Chain (which is alwayes
made to contain four Poles) is divided into 100 Links, one of theſe Links
being four times the length of the other. Now if this Chain be made according
to the Statute, each Perch to contain 16½ Feet, then each Link of this
Chain will contain 7 Inches, and 92/100 of an Inch, and the whole Chain 729
Inches, or 66 Foot.</p>
                  <p>In meaſuring with this Chain, you are to take notice only of
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:60174:34"/> Chains and Links, as ſaying ſuch a line meaſured by
the Chain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains 72 Chains 48 Links, which you may expreſſe more

neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to be taken notice of in Surveying of Land.</p>
                  <p>For the ready counting of the Links of this Chain, there ought
to be theſe diſtinctions, namely, In the middle thereof, which is at two
Poles end, let there be hanged a large Ring, or rather a plate of braſſe
like a Rhombus, ſo is the whole Chain (by this plate) divided into two equall
parts.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Let each of theſe two parts be divided into two
other equall parts, by ſmaller Rings or Circular plates of braſſe, ſo
ſhall the whole Chain be divided into four equall parts or Perches, each
Perch containing 25 Links.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, At every ten Links let be faſtened a leſſer
Ring then the former, or elſe a Plate of ſome other faſhion, as a
Semicircle, or the like. And laſtly, at every fift link (if you pleaſe) may
be faſtened other marks, ſo by this means you ſhall moſt eaſily and
exactly count the Links of your Chain without any trouble. The Chain being thus

your Inſtrument, Chain, and Mark, in a right line, which if you do not, you
muſt neceſſarily make your meaſured diſtance great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er then in reality
it is. For the avoyding of either of theſe miſtakes, you ought to provide
ten ſmall ſticks or Arrows, which let him that leadeth the Chain carry in
his hand before, and at the end of every Chain, ſtick one of theſe Arrows
into the ground, which let him that followeth the Chain take up, ſo going on
till the whole num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Arrows be ſpent, and then you may conclude that you
have meaſured ten Chains, without any further trouble, and theſe ten Chains
(if the diſtance you are to meaſure be large) you may call a Change, and
ſo you may denominate every large diſtance by Chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, Chains, and Links.
Or you may at the end of every ten Chains ſet up another kinde of ſtick, by
which (ſtanding at the Inſtrument) you may ſee whether your eye, the
ſtick, and the Mark to which you are to meaſure be in a right line or not,
and accordingly guide thoſe <pb n="49" facs="tcp:60174:34"/> that carry the Chain, with
the more exactneſſe to direct it to the Mark intended.</p>

                  <p>IN the practiſe of many Geometricall Concluſions, as in
the taking of Heights and Diſtances, hereafter taught, it is requiſite to
give your meaſure (in ſuch caſes) in Feet or Yards, and not in Poles or
Perches; yet becauſe your Chain is the moſt neceſſary Inſtrument to
meaſure withall, I thought it convenient in this place to ſhew you how to
reduce any number of Chains and Links into Feet, which is thus.</p>
                  <p>Multiply your number of Chains and Links together as one whole
number, by 66, cutting off from the product the two laſt figures towards the
right hand, ſo ſhall the reſt of the product be Feet, and the two figures
cut off ſhall be hundred parts of a Foot.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>EXAMPLE.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let it be required to know how many Feet are contained in 5
Chains, 32 Links. Firſt, Set down your 5 Chains, 32 Links as is before
taught, and as you ſee in the firſt Example, with a Comma between the
Chains and Links, then multiplying this 5 Chains, 32 Links by 66, the product
will be 35112, from which, cut off the two laſt figures toward the right hand
with a Comma, then will the number be 351,12, which is 351 Feet and 12/100
parts of a foot, and ſo many Feet are contained in 5 Chains, 32 Links.</p>

               <p>The Scale being thus divided, on the middle of the line AB, as
at H, deſcribe the Semicircle EGF, which divide into two Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drants in the
point G, by help of the perpendicular HG: then di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide each of thoſe
Quadrants into 90 equall parts called degrees, ſo ſhall the whole
Semicircle contain 180 degrees, which muſt be numbered by 10, 20, 30, 40,
&amp;c. to 180, from E by G to F, and the ſame way alſo from 180 to 360, as
you ſee done in the Figure, the numbers of the firſt Semicircle from 00 to
180 being for the Eaſt ſide of the Protractor, and the other numbers from
180 to 360 for the Weſt ſide.</p>
               <p>Now you are to note, that the line AB alwayes repreſenteth the
Meridian line, and is ſomtimes noted with the letters S and N, for South and
North, but then it is neceſſary that the Protractor be divided on either
ſide the plate, which this double numbering a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voydeth: for the line AB being
taken for the Meridian in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, the Semicircle of the Protractor may be
turned any way (either upward or downward) and ſo one Semicircle being
divided will be ſufficient; yet if any man be deſirous, he may have it made
accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his own fancie, but this manner of numbering (in my opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) is
the beſt, it being moſt agreeable to your Inſtruments.</p>
               <p>To uſe with this Protractor in protracting, you muſt provide
a fine needle, put into a piece of Box or Ivory neatly turned, this will
ſerve to fix in your center, note your degrees, and for other uſes in
drawing your Plot, and is called a Protracting pin.</p>

aſſigned quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, you muſt provide divers Scales. The Scales now
ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uſed by Surveyors, are principally two: Firſt, of equall parts,
for the protracting of lines: and Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, of Chords, for the protracting of
an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles. Unto theſe may be added, Thirdly, a Diagonall Scale, which is
(indeed) no other then a Scale of equall parts more ſcrupulouſly divided.
If you deſire a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient Scale, let it be made in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, to contain
in length about 8 or 9 Inches, &amp; in breadth one Inch and a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: on one
ſide there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of let be placed divers Scales, as of 10, 11, 12, 16, 20, 24, and
30 in an Inch.</p>
               <p>¶ Here is to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that when I ſay a Scale of 12 in
an Inch, you are to underſtand a part of a line divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into 10 equall
parts, 12 of which parts would make <pb n="53" facs="tcp:60174:36"/> an Inch, and the like
is to be underſtood of any other num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of equall parts whatſoever.</p>
               <p>On the ſame ſide of the Ruler let be placed a line of Chords
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended up to 90, and numbered as you ſee in the figure, by 10, 20, 30,
&amp;c. to 90. This Scale will be of good uſe for many purpoſes, as to
divide the circumference of a Circle, and to protract angles, in ſome caſes
better then the Protractor.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide of the Ruler let be drawn a Diagonall Scale,
of 10 in an Inch, which will be an excellent Scale for large Plots, out of
which you may very well take the hundred part of an Inch, and this Scale will
agree with your four Pole Chain exceeding well, for as your whole Chain
contains 100 Links, ſo each Inch of this Scale contains 100 parts, ſo that
out of it you may take any number meaſured by your Chain, to a Link, and lay
it down upon paper. You may alſo have halfe an Inch divided into 100 parts,
which Scale will be of good uſe alſo to lay down a ſmall Plot.</p>
               <p>Theſe Scales are many times put upon the Index of the Plain
Table, becauſe they ſhould be ready at hand when you ſurvey by the Table,
and plot your work as you go; but if you uſe the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees on the Frame of the
Table, or the Circumferentor, and keepe your account in a Book, then I would
adviſe you to have your Scale of Braſſe or Box neatly and exactly
divided.</p>
               <p>To uſe with this Scale, you muſt provide a pair of neat
Compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Braſſe, with ſteel points, filed very ſmall, and
alſo a neat pair of Compaſſes with three points, and Screws to alter the
points, ſo that you may draw lines or Circles with black lead, or any
coloured Inke, which will be very neceſſary and convenient in beautifying
of your Plots after Protraction.</p>

               <head>CHAP. III. The uſe of the Tables of Sines and Logarithms in
the reſolving of Plain Triangles.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Efore I come to ſhew how the quantity of the ſides and
angles of any Triangle may be found by help of the former Tables, it will be
convenient firſt to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver theſe following conſiderations and
Theoremes, as neceſſaries thereunto.</p>
               <p n="1">1. A Triangle is a figure conſiſting of three ſides
and three angles, as is the figure ABC.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p n="2">2. Any two ſides of a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angle are called the ſides
of the angle comprehended by them, as the ſides AB and AC are the ſides
containing the angle CAB. </p>
               <p n="3">3. The meaſure of an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle, is the quantity of an arch
of a Circle deſcribed on the angular point, and cutting both the containing
ſides of the ſame angle, as in the Triangle following, the arch CB, is the
meaſure of the angle at A; the arch KD is the meaſure of the angle at E;
and the arch FG is the meaſure of the angle at H; each of theſe arches are
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed on the angular points A, H, E, and cut the containing ſides.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p n="4">4. A Degree is the 360 part of any Circle</p>
               <p n="5">5. A Semicircle containeth 180 degrees.</p>
               <p n="6">6. A Quadrant containeth 90 degrees.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The complement of an angle leſſe then a Quadrant,
is ſo much as that angle wanteth of 90 degrees, as if the angle HAE ſhould
contain 50 degrees, the complement thereof would be 40 degrees, for if you take
50 from 90 there will remain 40.</p>
               <p n="8">
                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:60174:46"/>8. The complement of an angle to a
Semicircle, is the remainder thereof to 180 degrees.</p>
               <p n="9">9. An angle is either Right, Acute, or Obtuſe.</p>
               <p n="10">10. A Right angle is that whoſe meaſure is a
Quadrant.</p>
               <p n="11">11. An Acute angle is leſſe then a right angle.</p>
               <p n="12">12. An Obtuſe angle is greater then a Quadrant.</p>
               <p n="13">13. A Triangle is either Right angled, or Oblique
angled.</p>
               <p n="14">14. A Right angled Triangle is that which hath one right
angle, as the Triangle AHE is right angled at E.</p>
               <p n="15">15. In every right angled Triangle, that ſide which
ſubtendeth or lieth oppoſite to the right angle, is called the
Hypothenuſall, and of the other two ſides, the one is called the
Perpendicular, and the other the Baſe, at pleaſure, but moſt commonly the
ſhorteſt is called the Perpendicular, and the longer is called the Baſe.
So in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Triangle, the ſide AH is the Hypothenuſall, HE the
Baſe, and AE the Perpendicular.</p>
               <p n="16">16. In every right angled Triangle, if you have one of
the acute angles given, the other is alſo given, it being the complement
there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to 90 degrees. As in the Triangle AHE, ſuppoſe there were given
the angle AHE 40 degrees, then by conſequence the angle HAE muſt be 50
degrees, which is the complement of the other to 90 degrees.</p>
               <p n="17">17. The three angles of any right lined Triangle
whatſoever, are equall to two right angles, or to 180 degrees: ſo that if
in any right lined Triangle, you have any two of the angles given, you have the
third angle alſo given, it being the complement of the other two to 180
degrees.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>So in this Triangle ABC, if there were given the angle BAC 30
degrees, and the angle ACB 130 degrees, I ſay by conſequence there is
alſo given the third angle ABC 20 degrees, it being the complement of the
other two to 100 degrees: for, the two given an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles 30 and 130 being added
together, they make 160, which being taken from 180, there remains 20, the
quantity of the third angle ABC. </p>
               <p n="18">18. In all plain Triangles whatſoever, the ſides are
in proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one to the other, as the Sines of the angles oppoſite to
thoſe ſides. So in the Triangle ABC, the Sine of the angle ACB, is in
ſuch proportion to the ſide AB, as the Sine of the angle CAB is to the
ſide BC, and ſo of any other.</p>

Sines, and Tangents.</head>

ſhewed the uſe of the Tables of Sines and Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garithms, and alſo delivered
divers neceſſary Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rems relating to the menſuration of plain
Triangles, I come now to ſhew how a plain Triangle may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, that
is, by having any three of the ſix parts of a plain Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angle given, to finde
a fourth, both by the Tables of Sines and Logarithms, and alſo by the lines
of Artificiall Numbers, Sines and Tangents on the Index of your Table, ſo
that when your Tables are not ready at hand, you may make uſe of theſe
Lines, which will ſufficiently ſupply the want of them.</p>
               <p>In all the caſes following, I have made uſe but of two
Triangles for Examples, one right angled, and the other oblique angled, but in
either of them I have expreſſed all the varieties that are neceſſary,
ſo that any three parts being given in any of them, a fourth maybe found at
pleaſure.</p>

               <p>The ſeverall caſes of the right angled Triangle will beſt
be applied in the taking of heights, as is ſhewed in the next Book, and the
ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique angled Triangle for the taking of diſtances there alſo taught;
ſo that if the line CA in the right angled Triangle were a Tree, Tower, or
Steeple, and that you would know the height thereof, you muſt obſerve with
your Inſtrument the angle CBA, and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure the diſtance BA; ſo have
you in the right angled Triangle ABC the Baſe AB, and the angle at the Baſe
CBA, then may you (by the 1. Caſe) finde the ſide CA, which is the height
of the thing required.</p>

right line drawn upon the Table from the beginning of the degrees through the

of the Staffe, and there ſcrew it. Alſo, put the ſights into the Index,
and lay the Index on the Table, ſo is your Inſtrument prepared for uſe as
a Plain Table or Theodolite, the difference only being in placing of the Index,
for when you uſe your Inſtrument as a Plain Table, you may pitch your
center in any part of the Table, which you ſhall think moſt convenient for
the bringing on of the work which you intend: But if you uſe your
Inſtrument as a Theodolite, then the Index muſt be turned about upon the
Center of the Table, for which purpoſe there is a piece of wier which goes
through a ſmall hole of braſſe faſtened to the Index, and ſo into the
center, by which means the Index keepes his conſtant place, only moving up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the center.</p>
               <p>Your Inſtrument being thus ordered, you may uſe it either as
a Plain Table or a Theodolite, but if you would uſe it as a Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferentor,
you need only ſcrew the Box and Needle to the Index, and both of them to the
head of the Staffe, with a braſſe ſcrew-pin fitted for that purpoſe,

as a Circumferentor, before you put the Labell upon the braſſe pin or wier,
you muſt hang a line and plummet upon that pin, and then put on the Label,
then move the Index up and down till the thred and plummet hang directly upon a

the Plain Table, Theodolite, and Circumferentor, and alſo an angle of
Altitude by the Index, and the Labell there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto annexed. I conceive it now
convenient to ſhew how all manner of heights and diſtances may be readily
and exactly meaſured, ſeverall wayes, whether they be acceſſible or
inacceſſible: and firſt of diſtances.</p>
               <p>¶ You may remember that I formerly intimated, that the
mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring of a Height or Diſtance is only to reſolve a Triangle, ſo
that when you make any obſervation either of Height or Diſtance, the
obſervation of angles which you make are the angles of ſome Triangle, and
the lines which you meaſure on the ground, are the ſides of the ſame
Triangle, and theſe are the given parts of the Triangle.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="188" facs="tcp:60174:60"/>The manner how to take a diſtance by the
Plain Table is thus. Suppoſe you were ſtanding in a field at R, and that at
S were ſome eminent mark (as a Tree, Church, Houſe, or ſuch like) and
that it were required to finde the diſtance between R and S.</p>
               <p>Firſt, place your Table at R, and thereon aſſigne any
point at pleaſure, unto which point apply the edge of your Index, turning it
about upon that point, till through the ſights you eſpie the mark at S, and
draw a line by the ſide of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he
Index, as RS. </p>
               <p>Then in ſome other convenient place of the field (as at Q) let
a ſtaffe or other mark be erected, and the Table remaining as before, turn
the Index about, till through the ſights you eſpie the mark at Q, drawing a
line by the ſide thereof, as RQ, ſo have you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed upon your Table
an angle equall to the angle QRS. Then (with your Chain) meaſure the
diſtance QR, which let be 176 foot, then take with your Compaſſes 176 out
of any Scale, and ſet it upon your Table from R to Q, ſo ſhall this point
Q upon your Table, repreſent the mark at Q in the field.</p>
               <p>This done, ſet up a ſtaffe a R, and remove your Table to Q,
lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Index upon the line QR, and holding it faſt there, turn the whole
Table about till through the ſights you eſpie the mark ſet up at your
former place of ſtanding at R: then ſcrew the Table faſt, and lay the
Index on the point Q, turning it about, till through the ſights you eſpie
your mark at S, then draw a line by the ſide of the Index, which will cut the
line RS (firſt drawn) in the point S.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>By this means ſhall you have upon your Table a Triangle equall
to the Triangle QRS, the correſpondent ſides and angles thereof being
proportionally equall with thoſe in the field: therefore, if with your
Compaſſes you take the length of the ſide RS, and apply that diſtance
to the ſame Scale from whence you tooke the ſide QR, you ſhall finde it
to contain 400 foot, and that is the diſtance between R and S. Likewiſe, if
you take with your Compaſſes the length of the line QS, and apply it to the
ſame Scale, you ſhall finde it to contain almoſt 303, and ſo many foot
is the diſtance QS. </p>
               <p>¶ In this manner may the diſtance between any two places
be meaſured, although they be ſo ſcituated, that by reaſon of water or
other impediments you cannot approach neere unto them. And here note, rhat when
you take your ſecond ſtation, that you take it as large as the ground will
permit, <pb n="189" facs="tcp:60174:60"/> ſo ſhall your work be ſo much the truer, by
now much the diſtance taken is the larger.</p>

being alwayes towards you) the South end of the Needle cutting 36 degrees 45

your Protractor, ſo that the Meridian line EF of the Protractor, may lie
directly upon the Meridian line NS of this figure.</p>
               <p>Then laying your Field-book before you; ſeeing that at your

upon the paper that you would have the Plot of your Field deſcribed, draw a
line at pleaſure, as the line GA. Then place the center of your Protractor
upon the point A, and (becauſe the angle at your firſt obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation at A,
was 130 degrees 00 minutes) turn it about till the line AG lie directly under
130 degrees, and then at the beginning of the Protractor (which is at 00
degrees, noted (in the figure thereof <hi>pag.</hi> 51.) with the letter E,)
make a mark, and through it draw the line AB, ſetting 12 Chairs 5 Links (the
length of the ſame line) from A to B.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Lay the center of your Protractor upon the point B, and
ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the degrees cut at B were 120 degrees 30 minutes, therefore turn the
Protractor about till the line AB lies directly under 120 degrees 30 minutes,
and then at the beginnning of the degrees make a mark, and through it draw the
line BC, the length thereof being 4 Chains 45 Links.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Lay the center of the Protractor on the point C,
turning it about till the line BC lies directly under 137 degrees 30 minutes,
(which were the degrees cut at your obſervation at C,) and then making a mark
at the beginning or 00 degrees of your Protractor, through it draw the line CD,
ſetting 8 Chains 85 Links thereon from C to D.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Bring the center of your Protractor to the point D,
turning it about till the line CD lies directly under 120 degrees 30 minutes,
and then making a mark at the beginning of the Protractor, through it draw the
line DE, and upon it ſet 13 Chains 4 links, from D to E.</p>
               <p>In this manner muſt yon deale with all the reſt of the
angles, and when you come to protract the angle at F, which is the laſt
angle, and have drawn the line FG, you ſhall finde it to cut the line AG
firſt drawn in the point G, leaving the line AG to contain 7 Chains 87 Links,
and the line FG 5 Chains 67 Links; and in this, practiſe is better then many
words, and the ſight of the figure better then a whole Chapter of
information, in which figure you may ſee the Protractor lie at every angle in
its true poſition.</p>
               <p>This work may be performed otherwiſe, by protracting your
laſt obſervation firſt, ſo having drawn the line AG, lay the center of
the Protractor on G, and the Meridian line thereof (namely EF) on the line GA,
then (becauſe the degrees cut at your obſervation at G were 143 degrees 30
minutes) make a mark with your protracting pin againſt 143 degrees 30
minutes, and through it draw the line GF, upon which line from G to F, ſet 5
Chains 67 Links.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p> Then placing the center of your Protractor on the point F, and
the Meridian line thereof upon the line FG, making a mark by the edge of the
Protractor againſt 126 degrees 30 minutes (which were the degrees cut by the
Index at your obſervation at F) and through that point draw the line FE,
ſetting 7 Chains 70 Links thereupon from F to E.</p>
               <p>And in this manner muſt you proceed with the reſt of the
lines and angles, and at laſt you ſhall finde the plot of your field to
cloſe at A, as before it did at G, and if the ſides and angles were never
ſo many, the manner of the work would be the ſame.</p>
               <p>¶ Here note that if in going about a field, and meaſuring
the angles thereof with the Theodolite or degrees on the frame of the Table (as
in <hi>Chap.</hi> 32.) that if you meet with any angle that bendeth inwards in
the Field, you muſt reckon that angle to be ſo much above 180 degrees as
the bending is, and when you note the degrees of ſuch an angle in your
Field-book, you may make this &gt; or the like mark againſt them for a
remembrance when you come to protract, and in protracting you muſt turn the
Semicircle of the Protractor the contrary way to what you do in protracting of
other angles.</p>

               <p>In going about a field in this manner, you may perceive a
wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full quick diſpatch, for you are only to take notice of the degrees
cut once at every angle, and not to uſe any back-ſights as in the fore
going work of the Theodolite: but to uſe back-ſights with the
Circumferentor is beſt for to confirm your work; for when you ſtand at any
angle of a field, and direct your ſights to the next, and obſerve what
degrees the South end of the needle cutteth, if you remove your Inſtrument
from this angle to the next, and looke to the mark or angle where it laſt
ſtood, with your back-ſights, the Needle will there alſo cut the ſame
degree as before, which ought to be done, and may be, without much loſſe of
time.</p>
               <p>So the Inſtrument being placed at A if you direct the ſights
to B, you ſhall finde the Needle to cut 191 degrees, then removing your
Inſtrument to B, if you direct the back-ſights to A, the Needle will then
alſo cut 191 degrees.</p>
               <p>Now for diſpatch and exactneſſe (if the Needle be good,
the Card well divided, and the degrees (by a good eye) truly eſtimated) the
Circumferentor, for large and ſpacious grounds is as good as any, and
therefore obſerve well the manner of protracting.</p>

which were 191 degrees, now, becauſe the degrees were more then 180, you
muſt therefore lay the ſemicircle of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractor downwards, and holding

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He uſe of the Plain Table, Theodolite and Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferentor,
hath been ſufficiently taught in the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Chapters, and their agreement
in all kinde of practiſes fully intimated, ſo that you may perceive by what
hath been hitherto delivered, that for ſome kinde of works one Inſtrument
is better then ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and for large and ſpacious buſineſſes, the
Circumferentor is the beſt (the Needle being good, and no impediment neere to
hinder the playing or vertue thereof) there being only this objection to be
made againſt it, <hi>viz.</hi> that the degrees in the Card are (for the
moſt part) ſo ſmall that they cannot be truly eſtimated, and ſo may
occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion the greater errour in protraction. For the ſalving of this grand
inconvenience, Maſter <hi>Rathborn</hi> hath a contrivance in his Book of
Surveying (by an Inſtrument which he calleth a Peractor, which is no other
then a Theodolite, only the Box and Needle is ſo fitted to the center of the
Inſtrument, that when the Inſtrument is fixed in any poſition
whatſoever, the Index may be turned about, and yet the Box and Needle remain
immoveable. The benefit of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance is, that whereas in the
Circumferentor the degrees are cut by the Needle, here the ſame degrees are
cut by the Index, and therefore are larger, the uſe whereof is thus.</p>
               <p>Place the Peractor at any angle of a field, and turn it about
till the Needle hang directly over the Meridian line in the Card, then fix the
Inſtrument there, and turn the Index about till through the ſights you
eſpie the mark or angle you would looke at, then ſhall the Index cut the
ſame degrees and minutes upon the Limbe of the Peractor, as the Needle would
have cut upon the Card of the Circumferentor, if uſed as is before taught:
yet notwithſtanding this contrivance, you ſee you muſt be beholding to
the Needle, the convenience only being, that the degrees which you are to note
in your Field-book, are larger upon the limb of the Inſtrument then in the
Card, which (I confeſſe) is ſomthing conſiderable.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>Let ABCDE be a Field to be meaſured by the Index and Needle on
the Plain Table, ſupplying the uſe of the Peractor.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Place your Inſtrument at A, laying the Index and
ſights with the Box and Needle ſcrewed thereto upon the Diameter of the
Table, then the Index ſo lying, turn the whole Inſtrument about till the
Needle hang directly over the Meridian line in the Card, then ſcrew the
Inſtrument faſt, and turn the Index about upon the center, till through the
ſights you eſpie your ſecond angle at B, then you ſhall ſee that the
South end of the Needle will cut upon the Card in <pb n="238" facs="tcp:60174:85"/> the
Box, about 218 degrees, and the Index (at the ſame time) upon the Table will
cut 218 degrees 10 minutes, which muſt be noted down in your Field book as
hath been ſeverall times before taught, and meaſure the diſtance AB, 9
Chains 65 Links, which you muſt note down in your Field-book alſo.</p>
               <p>¶ By this you may ſee the convenience of counting the
degrees cut by the Index rather then by the Needle, as here you ſee 10
minutes are loſt in eſtimation, which the Index giveth more preciſely,
nay ſomtimes you may poſſibly miſſe halfe or a whole degree by the
Needle.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Place your Inſtrument at B, laying the Index on the
diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thereof, and turn the Inſtrument about till the Needle hang over
the Meridian line in the Card, then fixing the Inſtrument there, turn the
Index and ſights to C, ſo ſhall both the Needle in the Box, and the Index
on the frame of the Table cut 298 degrees 30 minutes, and meaſuring the
diſtance BC, you ſhall finde it to contain 9 Chains 28 Links, the degrees
and minutes, and the length of the line mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, muſt be noted down in
your Field-book as before.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Place your Inſtrument at C, and lay the Index and
ſights up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the diameter thereof, then turn the Inſtrument about till the
Needle hang over the Meridian line, then fixing it there, turn the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dex about
till through the ſights you eſpie the fourth angle at D, then will both the
Needle and Index cut 15 degrees 40 minutes, theſe degrees and minutes, with
the meaſured diſtance CD 5 Chains 70 Links, muſt be ſet down in your
Field-book.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Your Inſtrument being placed at D, with the Index on
the diameter thereof, turn it about till the Needle hang over the Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian
line, and there fixing it, turn the Index about till through the ſights you
ſee the next angle at E, then will both the Needle and Index cut 68 degrees,
and the diſtance CE will be 8 Chains 72 Links, which note in your Field-book
as before.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Laſtly, place your Inſtrument at E (obſerving all
the former cautions) and direct the ſights to A, where you ſhall finde both
the Needle and Index to cut 142 degrees 45 minutes, and the meaſured
diſtance EA to be 7 Chains 11 Links, which note down in your Field-book.</p>
               <p>And thus may you go about any field, let it conſiſt of never
ſo many ſides and angles, obſerving alwayes this generall rule, to lay
the Index with the Box and Needle, on the diameter of the Table, and to turn
the Table about till the Needle hangs directly over the meridian line in the
Card, and then fixing the Table, turn the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dex about till through the

Glaſſe or the like, doth depend upon the exact meaſuring of certain
regular figures, as the Geometricall Square, the Long Square or Parallelogram,
the Triangle, the Trapezia, and the Circle: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if any plot of Land to

multiplyed were 9.50, and 6.25, theſe being multiplyed one by another produce
593750, and the five laſt figures being cut off, there will be 5 Acres, and
93750 remaining: now to know how many Roods and Perches are contained therein
by the Scale,</p>
                  <p>¶ You muſt conſider that 25000 ſquare Links are
equall to one Rood or 40 Perches, as appeareth by the Scale it ſelfe, and
alſo by the Table, then is 50000 equall to 2 Roods, and 75000 equall to 3
Roods; therefore, if your number re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining exceed 25000, and be under 50000,
you may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude 1 Rood and odde perches to be contained therein. If it exceed
50000, and be under 75000, you may conclude 2 Roods and ſome odde perches to
be therein. If above 75000, you may then conclude 3 Roods and odde perches to
be therein.</p>
                  <p>Now in this example, the number remaining is 93750, which
becauſe it exceedeth 75000, I conclude there is 3 Roods contained therein,
which I ſet to the 5 Acres, and ſubſtract 75000 from 93750, the ramainder
being 18750, this number, eighteen thouſand ſeven hundred and fifty, I
ſeeke in the Scale of Square Links, and right againſt it I finde 30
perches, which added to the former, giveth 5 Acres, 3 Roods and 30 Perches,

                  <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Y the 6 <hi>Prop.</hi> of the laſt Chapter you may perform
this work by the line of Numbers as is there taught, but however, it will not
be amiſſe in this place to ſhew how to performe the ſame
Arithmetically, that the reaſon thereof may the better appear. Now where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
(by the forementioned Statute) an Acre of ground was to contain 160 ſquare
perches, meaſured by the Pole or Perch of 16 foot and a halfe, but in many
places of this Nation (through long cuſtome) there hath been received other
quantities, called Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomarie, as namely, of 18, 20, 24, and 28 foot to the
Pole or Perch.</p>
               <p>It is therefore neceſſary for a Surveyor to know how readily
to reduce Cuſtomarie meaſure to Statute meaſure, and the contrary.</p>
               <p>Suppoſe then, that it were required to reduce 5 Acres, 2
Roods, <pb n="255" facs="tcp:60174:93"/> 20 Perches, meaſured by the 18 foot Pole into
Statute meaſure, you muſt ſeeke out the leaſt proportionall terms
between 18 foot, and 16 foot and a halfe, which to perform do thus. Becauſe
16 and a halfe beareth a fraction, reduce 16 and a halfe into halves, and that
both your numbers may be of one denomination, you muſt reduce 18 (the
cuſtomary Pole) into halves alſo, then will your numbers ſtand thus
33/36, which abreviated by 3, by ſaying how many times 3 in 33? the quotient
will be 11, and again, how many times 3 in 36? the quotient will be 12, ſo
will the two proportionall terms between 16 and a halfe and 18, be 11 and
12.</p>
               <p>This done, reduce your given quantity (5 Acres, 2 Roods, and 20
perches) into perches, which makes 900 perches: Now conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that what
proportion the ſquare of 11, which is 121, bears to the ſquare of 12, which
is 144, the ſame proportion doth the Acre of 16 foot and a halfe to the
Perch, bear to the Acre of 18 foot to the Perch.</p>
               <p>Now (becauſe the greater meaſure is to be reduced into the
leſſer) multiply the given quantity 900 perches, by 144, the greater
ſquare, and the product will be 129600, which divided by 121, the quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
will be 1071 9/<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>But on the contrary, ſuppoſe it had been required to reduce
Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute meaſure into Cuſtomary meaſure, then you muſt have multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
900 perches (your given quantity) by 121 the leſſer Square, (becauſe the

756¼ perches, which reduced into Acres is 4 A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cres, 2 Roods 36 perches

notice of all the bounds thereof, then provide a Book or paper which muſt be
ruled or divided into 8 Columns, in the firſt where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of towards the left hand
is to be written the Tenants name, and the tenor by which he holds the ſame
Land, the two next Columns are to contain the length of every mans Furlong in

Letters over the head of each column doth appear.</p>
               <p>In the three laſt Columns is to be expreſſed the quantity
of each tenants Furlong in Acres, Roods and Perches.</p>
               <p>In the laying out of ſeverall parcels in this kinde, you will
have uſe only of your Chain; then when you begin your work, you muſt
firſt write the name of the field, and in the firſt columne of your Booke

the ſame, from what place you begin to meaſure, and upon what point of the
compaſſe you paſſe from thence, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving this direction in all
the reſt, you may (if need require) bound every parcell.</p>
               <p>This being noted in your Book, obſerve the ſpecies or
ſhape of the Furlong, whether it be all of one length or not, if of one
length, then you need take the length thereof but once for all, but if it be
irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, that is, in ſome places ſhorter and in others longer, then you
muſt take the length thereof at every ſecond or third breadth, and
expreſſe the ſame in your Book under the title of length. As for the
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing of the ſeverall breadths, you need but to croſſe over the
whole Furlong, taking every mans breadth by the middle thereof, and entering
the ſame as you paſſe along, but in caſe there be a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable

either end, and adde them together into one ſum, then take the half of that
ſumme for your mean or true breadth, and enter it in your book or paper under
the title of breadth.</p>
               <p>In this manner you may proceed from one Furlong to another till
you have gone through the whole field, which when you have done and noted down

regard there are many hils and val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys all over the field, you muſt
meaſure with your Chain in the field over hill and dale from B to D, and to
the line BD ſet the number of Chains and links as you finde them by
meaſuring, which will be much longer then the ſtreight line BD meaſured
on your Scale; then by help of your Inſtrument finde the point H in the line
BD, and 
<figure/> meaſure with your Chain from C to H, over hill and
dale as before, and to this perpendicular CH ſet the number as you finde it
by the Chain: then finde the perpendicular IE, and meaſure that with your
Chain alſo, all which lines (in reſpect of the hils and vallies) will be
found much longer then if they were meaſured by your Scale: then by the
meaſured lines BD, CH and IE, caſt up the content of the Trapezia BCDE. In
this manner you muſt caſt up the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of the Trapezia ABEG, and the
Triangle GEF, and this is the exacteſt way I can preſcribe for the
menſuration of uneven grounds, which being well and carefully performed, will
not vary much of the true content: For it is apparent that if ſuch mountanous
grounds were plotted truly according to their area <hi>in plano,</hi> the
figure thereof would not be contained within its proper limits, and being laid
down amongſt other grounds would ſwell beyond the bounds, and force the
adjoyning grounds out of their places; now for diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in your Plot you
may ſhadow them off with hils as in this figure, leſt any man ſeeing your
plot ſhould meaſure by your Scale, and finde your work to differ.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XLVIII. How to take the Plot of a whole Mannor, or of
divers parſels of Land lying together, whether Wood-lands or Champion plains,
by the <hi>Plain Table.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lthough practiſe, in the performance hereof, be better then
many words, and that the rules already delivered are of ſufficient extent to
perform the work of this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, yet (for farther ſatisfaction in this
particular) I will herein deliver the moſt ſure and compendious way I can
imagine.</p>
               <p>Suppoſe therefore that the following figure ALMNPQSTYXGH and K
were part of a Mannor, or divers parcels of land lying together, and that it
were required to take the plot thereof upon your Plain Table.</p>
               <p>Now the beſt way (in my opinion) is firſt to go round about
the whole quantity to be meaſured, and draw upon your Table a perfect plot
thereof, as if it were one entire field (which you may do by the 31
<hi>Chap.</hi> of this Book) and then to make ſeparation and diviſion
thereof in an orderly way, as is taught in this Chapter: But before you begin
your work, it will be very neceſſary to ride or walke about the whole
Mannor, or at leaſt ſo much as you are to ſurvey, that you may be the
better acquainted with the ſeverall bounders, and in your paſſage you
ought to take ſpeciall notice of all eminent things lying in your way, as
Churches, Houſes, Mils, High-wayes, Rivers, &amp;c. which will much help you,
alſo in this your paſſage it were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to take notice of ſome
convenient place to begin your work as followeth.</p>
               <p>Having made choice of ſome convenient place in the peripherie
or outward part of the Mannor, as at A, place there your Table, turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it
about till the Needle hang over the Meridian line in the Card, and there fix
it, then upon the Table (with moſt convenience) aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne any point at
pleaſure, as A, unto which point lay the Index, and turn it about till
through the ſights you ſee a mark ſet up at the next angle at L, then by
the ſide of the Index draw the line AL, which ſuppoſe to contain 8 Chains
68 links, take theſe 8 Chains 68 links from any Scale, and place that length
upon your Table from A to L.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p n="3">3. Remove your Table to M, and lay the Index upon the line
ML, turning the Table about till through the ſights you eſpie a mark ſet
up at the angle L, where your Table laſt ſtood, and there fixing it, you
ſhall ſtill finde the Needle to hang directly over the Meridian line, if
you proceed truly in your work: then laying the Index to the point M, turn it
about till through the ſights you eſpie ſome mark ſet up at the next
angle at N, and draw a line by the ſide of the Index, then meaſuring with
your Chain from M to N, you ſhall finde it to contain 7 Chains 27 links,
which take from the ſame Scale as before, and place the length thereof upon
your Table from M unto N.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Place your Inſtrument at N, laying the Index upon the
line NM, and turn the Table about till through the ſights you ſee a mark
ſet up at your former ſtation at M, and there fix the Table, ſo will the
needle hang over the meridian line as before, then turn the Index about upon
the point N, till through the ſights you eſpie the next angle at P, and
draw a line by the ſide thereof, then meaſure the diſtance NP 9 Chains 32
links, which take from the Scale, and ſet it upon your Table from N unto
P.</p>
               <p>In this manner muſt you go round about the whole Mannor,
making obſervation at every angle thereof, as at P Q S T Y X G H and K, and
ſetting down the length of every line upon your Table as you finde it by
meaſuring with your Chain, you ſhall have upon <pb n="262" facs="tcp:60174:97"/> your
Table the figure of one large plain; which muſt include all the reſt of the
work, and in thus going about you ſhall (if you have truly wrought all the
way) finde your plot to cloſe exactly in the point A, where you began, but if
it do not, go over your work again, for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, all that you do
afterwards within the ſame will be falſe.</p>
               <p>¶ Here note, that if one ſheet of paper will not contain
your whole plot, you muſt then ſhift your paper in this manner: when any
line falleth off of your Table, draw two lines at right angles croſſe your
paper, which the equall diviſions on the frame will help you to do; then lay
another clean ſheet of paper upon your Table, and by the ſame parallel
di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions at the contrary end of the Table, draw two other lines at right
angles, and upon them note what part of your Plot croſſed the two other
lines before drawn, and at thoſe points begin to go forward with the reſt
of your work: and thus may you ſhift divers papers one after another, if need
be.</p>
               <p>Having thus drawn the true plot of the outward bounds or
peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pherie of the whole Mannor upon your Table, as the figure ALMNPQSTYXGH and
K; and exactly cloſed your plot at A where you began, you may proceed now to
lay out the ſeverall Cloſes therein contained, in this manner.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Place your Table at A, laying the Index and ſights
upon the line AL before drawn, and turn it about till through the ſights you
eſpie the angle L, and there fixing it, the needle will hang directly over
the Meridian line in the Card: then turn the Index about upon the point A, till
through the ſights you eſpie a mark ſet up at the angle B, and by the
ſide of the Index draw the line AB containing 6 Chains 43 Links.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Remove the Table to B, laying the Index on the line BA,
and turn the Table about till through the ſights you ſee the angle A, then
fix it, and turn the Index about upon B, till you ſee the next angle at C,
drawing the line BC by the ſide of the Index, which ſuppoſe to contain 8
Chains 5 Links.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Place the Table at C, laying the Index upon the line
CB, and turn it about till through the ſights you ſee your former ſtation
at B, and there fixing it, turn the Index about upon the point C, till through
the ſights you ſee the angle at E, and draw the line CE con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining 10
Chains 22 Links which ſet from C to E, and again (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you move your
Table) direct the ſights to O and draw the line OC containing 6 Chains 64
links, which take from your Scale and ſet from C to O, and (becauſe O is
the next angle to the bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er) you may (without placing your Inſtrument at
O, or meaſuring the diſtance ON) draw the line ON upon your Table, which
(if the reſt of the work be true) will contain 4 Chains 45 links.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p n="5">5. Remove your Inſtrument to T, laying the Index upon
the line TS, and turn it about till through the ſights you eſpie the angle
at S, &amp; there fixing it, turn the Index about upon the point T, till
through the ſights you eſpie the next angle at V, and by the ſide of the
In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dex draw the line TV containing 6 Chains 15 Links, which ſet upon the
Table from T to V: now (becauſe V is the angle next the bounder) you may only
draw the line VG, without placing your Inſtrument at V, or meaſuring the
diſtance VG upon the ground, which (if the reſt of the work be true) will
contain 6 Chains 38 Links.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Bring your Inſtrument to Q, and lay the Index upon
the line PQ, turning the Table about till through the ſights you ſee the
angle at P, then fixing the Table there, turn the Index about upon the point Q,
till through the ſights you eſpie the angle at R, and by the ſide of the
Index draw the line QR containing 10 Chains 75 Links, which ſet from Q to
R.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Bring your Table to R, and laying the Index on the
line QR, turn the Table about till through the ſights you ſee the angle at
Q, and there fix it, then turn the Index about upon the point R, till through
the ſights you eſpie the angle at D, and draw the <pb n="264" facs="tcp:60174:98"/>
line RD, which (if the reſt of the work be true) will contain 5 Chains 3
Links.</p>
               <p>Thus have you an exact and perfect draught of the whole Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,
or of ſeverall incloſures, in the performance whereof I have been
ſomthing large, becauſe I would ſhew the moſt naturall way firſt: but
the ſame thing may be performed with more brevity as followeth, wherein (if
you mark it well) you ſhall plainly perceive that halfe the work will be
abreviated, and the ſame thing effected with almoſt halfe the
meaſuring.</p>
               <p>Having made choice of the angle A to begin your work, place your
Table there, turning it about till the Needle hang directly over the Meridian
line in the Card, and there fix it, then aſſigne any point upon the Table,
for your beginning ſtation, as the point A, and lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Index to this
point, turn it about till through the ſights you eſpie the next angle at L,
then draw the line AL containing 8 Chains 68 Links, which take from your Scale
and ſet from A to L: and alſo (before you move your Table) direct the
ſights to B, and by the ſide of the Index draw the line AB, but you need
not meaſure the length thereof.</p>
               <p n="2">2: Then go forward with your work as in the former part of
this Chapter, placing your Table at the angles L M and N, and when you come to
N, and have drawn the line NP, you may (before you move your Table) draw the
line NO, but not meaſure it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Alſo when you come to the angle Q, and have drawn the
line QS, you may draw the line QR alſo, at once placeing of the Table.</p>
               <p n="4">4. When you come to obſerve at the angle T, and have
drawn the line TY, you may at the ſame time alſo draw the line TV, but need
not meaſure it.</p>
               <p n="5">5. When you come to the angle G, and have drawn the line
GH, you may alſo draw the line GV, which will cut the line TV in the point V;
and at the ſame time alſo you may draw the line GF containing 6 Chains 68
Links.</p>
               <p>Having thus gon round the whole Mannor, and made a plot of the
outward part or peripherie thereof, and alſo drawn the lines AB, NO, QR, TV,
GV and GF, as you went along the bounder, the remainder of the work will (by
this means) be much abreviated, for you have no more to do, but</p>
               <p n="1">1. To place your Table at F, laying the Index upon the
line FG, and to turn it about till through the ſights you eſpie the angle
at G, and fixing it there direct the ſights to E, and draw the line EF
containing 5 Chains 50 Links.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Place the Table at E, and lay the Index on the line EF,
turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Table about, till you ſee through the ſights the angle F, then
fix it, and turn the Index about upon the point E till through the ſights you
eſpie the angle at C, and by the ſide of the Index draw the line EDC, which
containeth 10 Chains 22 Links. Then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that from C to D there is 4
Chains, ſet 4 Chains from C to D and draw the line DR, which will cut the
line QR in the point R, leaving the line DR to contain 5 Chains 3 Links.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>Laſtly, place the Table at C, laying the Index on the line CE,
turning it about till through the ſights you ſee the angle at E, and there
fixing it, turn the Index about upon the point C, and direct the ſights to B
and O, drawing the lines CB and CO. And thus have you upon your Table an exact
plot of your Mannor with great eaſe and celerity.</p>
               <p>There is yet another way to perform this work: when you have
taken the true plot of the outward bounds or peripherie of the whole Mannor
upon a ſheet or more of paper; if you will take the pains to go over every
particular incloſure again, and draw particular plots of every parcell by the
ſame Scale wherewith you laid down the plot of the peripherie; then over the
plot of every particular Inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, draw parallel Meridians, and when you
have thus plotted e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very particular, if you cut them off by their bounders, and
lay them one by another according to their ſituation within the plot of the
whole peripherie, you ſhall finde that thoſe plots (if your work be true)
will juſtly fill the plot of the whole, leaving no vacuity.</p>

               <p>I have here added one leafe of your Field-book as it ought to be

the diſtance of which lines one from another muſt not exceed the breadth of

               <p>Now ſuppoſe you were to protract the obſervations of the
laſt Chapter, laying your Field-book before you, conſider which way your
plot will extend, and accordingly begin your work, as at the point A, upon
which point A place the center of your Protractor, tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning it about, till the
correſpondent diviſions at each end of the Scale of the Protractor lie
directly upon one of the parallel meridians, and ſtaying the Protractor
there, look in your Field-book what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees and minutes the needle cut at your
firſt obſervation at A, which <pb n="272" facs="tcp:60174:103"/> were 160 degrees 45
minutes, therefore againſt 160 degrees 45 mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes of your Protractor, make a
mark, and through that mark and the point A, draw the line AL, containing 8
Chains 68 Links.</p>
               <p>Then place the center of the Protractor upon the point L, in all
reſpects as before, and finding your next degrees and length to be 181
degrees 30 minutes, and the length 6 Chains 55 Links, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore againſt 181
degrees 30 minutes of your Protractor make a mark, and through it draw the line
LM containing 6 Chains 55 Links.</p>
               <p>Then place the center of the Protractor upon the point M, and
looke in your Field-book what degrees were cut at M, protract thoſe degrees
(as before) and draw the line MN containing 7 Chains 27 Links.</p>
               <p>Then place the center of the Protractor upon the point N, the
degrees cut being 355 degrees 40 minutes, and the line NO con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining 4 Chains
45 Links, and becauſe againſt theſe 355 degrees 40 minutes you finde in
your Field-book this mark + there placed, you muſt therefore (with Black

               <p>In this manner muſt you proceed with all the other lines and
an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles as you finde them noted in your Field-book, till you have gone over
your firſt Cloſe, and cloſed your plot at A.</p>
               <p>Having thus finiſhed your firſt incloſure, you muſt
deale in the ſame manner with the ſecond, third and fourth, and ſo on,

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T may ſo fall out that when you have taken the plot of a
whole Mannor upon your Plain Table, in divers ſheets of paper, or obſerved
the angles, and afterwards protracted them, as in the two laſt Chapters, it
may ſo fall out that your plot may be either bigger or leſſer then is
deſired, now if at any time it be required to inlarge or diminiſh any plot
according to any proportion, this Chapter will accompliſh your deſire.</p>
               <p>The Inſtruments for the performance hereof are divers, as was
intimated in the 9 Chapter of the 2 Book. Now for generality and
exactneſſe, the two Indexes there ſpoken of, having at each end thereof a
Semicircle, is inferiour to none, but the Inſtrument being very chargeable,
and the uſe thereof very intricate and tedious, I ſhall wholly omit to
ſpeak any more of it.</p>
               <p>There is another way alſo which Maſter <hi>Rathborn</hi>
uſed, which was with a Ruler by him invented for that purpoſe, which would
indifferent well reduce a plot from one bigneſſe to another according to
ſome particular proportions. The making of this Ruler is ſo well known, and
the uſe thereof ſo apparent, that I ſhall not need to ſay any thing
concerning the deſcription or uſe of it: I only inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate that there is
ſuch a Ruler, that thoſe which pleaſe may have it made.</p>
               <p>Another way is by one line divided into 100 or 1000 equall parts
only, which by the help of Arithmetick will perform this work very well, but
this (as being very tedious) I neglect.</p>
               <p>To paſſe by theſe and divers others which I could name, I
ſhall ſay ſomthing of the Parallelogram, which for generality,
exactneſſe, and diſpatch, ſurpaſſeth all the reſt, unto which (in
my opinion) there is none comparable. Of Parallelograms there are diverſe
ſorts, but that which I ſhall inſtance in, conſiſteth but of four
Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers only, the making whereof is well known to the Inſtrument maker, and
the manner of uſing it is as followeth.</p>
               <p>Take the plot which you would reduce, and faſten it to a Table
with Mouth-glew, then by it, upon the ſame Table, faſten your fair paper or
parchment, upon which you would have your new plot; then having fitted your
Parallelogram according to the proportion into which you would have your plot
reduced, fix the Parallelogram to the Table, by a point for that purpoſe:
then put your drawing pen into ſome one hole on one of the ſides of the
Parallelogram, and upon it a plummet of lead or braſſe to keepe the pen
down cloſe to the paper, when it is moved thereupon: and here note, that at
any time when the Parallelogram is thus fitted, the point that ſticketh 
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:60174:104"/> in the Table, the Pen which is to draw, and the Tracer
which you muſt move along the lines of your old plot, will lie alwayes in a
right line, but this by the way: Your Parallelogram being fixed to the Table,
and the pen in its true place fitted to draw, take the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer in your right
hand, and with it, lightly go over all the lines of your old plot, ſo ſhall
the motion thereof occaſion the pen to draw upon your clean paper or
parchment, the true and exact figure of your former Plot, though of another
bigneſſe, which will be in proportion to the greater according to the
ſituation of the ſides of the Parallelogram, which will better appeat by
the ſight of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, then words can poſſibly explain it.</p>

Spring head to any determinate place, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the following directions.</p>
                  <p>Place your Water-Levell at ſome convenient diſtance from
the Spring head, in a right line towards the place to which the water is to be
conveyed, as at 30, 40, 60, or 100 yards diſtant from the Spring-head. Then
having in a readineſſe two long ſtreight poles (which you may call your
ſtation ſtaves) divided into Feet, Inches, and parts of Inches from the
bottome upwards: being thus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, cauſe one (whom you may call your

Spring head, and require another (which you may call your <hi>ſecond
aſsiſtant</hi>) to erect the other ſtaffe beyond your Inſtrument at 30,
40, 60, or 100 yards forward, towards the place to which the water ſhould be
conveyed. Theſe ſtation ſtaves being erected perpendicular, and your
Water-Levell in the mid way preciſely horizontall, go to the end of the
Levell, and looking through the ſights, cauſe your <hi>firſt
aſsiſtant</hi> to move a leafe of paper up and down your ſtation
ſtaffe, till through the ſights you ſee the very edge thereof, and then
by ſome known ſigne or ſound, intimate to him that the paper is then in
its true poſition, then let this <hi>firſt aſſiſtant</hi> note
againſt what number of Feet, Inches, and parts of an Inch the edge of the
paper reſteth, which he muſt note down in a paper. Then your Water-Levell
remaining immoveable, go to the other end thereof, and looking through the
ſights towards your other ſtation ſtaffe, cauſe your <hi>ſecond
aſsiſtant</hi> to move a leafe of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per along the ſtaffe, till you ſee
the very edge thereof through the ſights, and then (by ſome known ſigne
or ſound) cauſe him to take notice what number of Feet, Inches, and parts
of an Inch, are cut by the ſaid paper, which will him alſo to keepe in
minde, or note in a paper as your <hi>firſt aſsiſtant</hi> did.</p>
                  <p>This done, require your <hi>firſt aſsiſtant</hi> to
bring his ſtation ſtaffe from the Spring head, and cauſe your
<hi>ſecond aſsiſtant</hi> to take that ſtaffe and carry it forward
towards the place to which the water is to be conveyed, 30, 40, 60, or 100
yards, and there to erect it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular as before, letting your <hi>firſt

move a paper up and down, and when you give him a <pb n="277" facs="tcp:60174:105"/>
ſigne to note what number of Feet, Inches, and parts of an Inch are cut by
the paper, and note them down, then going to the other end of your
Water-Levell, look through the ſights, and cauſe your <hi>ſecond
aſsiſtant</hi> to move a paper along the Staffe, and to note the Feet,
Inches, and parts of an Inch as before.</p>
                  <p>Then cauſe your <hi>firſt aſsiſtant</hi> to bring away
his ſtation-ſtaffe, and cauſe your <hi>ſecond aſsiſtant</hi> to

which the water is to be conveyed, and leaving your <hi>firſt
aſsiſtant</hi> at the place where your <hi>ſecond aſsiſtant</hi>
laſt ſtood, place your Water-Levell again in the mid way between your two
Aſſiſtants, and looking through the ſights as before, cauſe each of
them to move a leafe of paper up and down their ſtation ſtaves, and note
down in their ſeverall papers the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Feet, Inches, and parts of an
Inch cut, when you looked through the ſights of your Water-levell.</p>
                  <p>In this manner you muſt go along from the Spring head, to
the place unto which you would have the water conveyed, and if there be never
ſo many ſeverall ſtations, you muſt, in all of them, obſerve this
manner of work preciſely, ſo by comparing the notes of your two
Aſſiſtants together, you may eaſily know whether the water may be
conveyed from the Spring head to the deſired place or not.</p>
                  <p>¶ Here note, that in your paſſage between the Spring
head and the appointed place, from ſtation to ſtation, you muſt
ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve this order, otherwiſe great errour will enſue, <hi>viz.</hi>
that your <hi>firſt aſsiſtant</hi> muſt at every ſtation, ſtand

place to which the water is to be conveyed, thus by obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving this order in
your work you ſhall have no confuſion, neither ſhall one of your
Aſſiſtants take more pains then the other.</p>
                  <p>Having thus orderly proceeded from the Spring head to the
place appointed, call both your Aſſiſtants together, and cauſe them to
give in their notes of the obſervations at each ſtation, and adde them
together ſeverally: then if the note of the <hi>ſecond aſsiſtant</hi>

of an Inch: and the notes of your <hi>ſecond aſsiſtant</hi> at his
ſeverall ſtations being added together amounteth to 21 Feet and 2 Inches,
ſo the number of the <hi>firſt aſsiſtants</hi> obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons being
taken from the number of the ſecond, there will remain 2 Feet, 3 Inches and
¼ of an Inch, and ſo much is the place to which the water is to be
brought, lower then the Spring head, according to the ſtreight Water-Levell,
and therefore the water may eaſily be conveyed thither.</p>
                  <p>¶ Here note, that when you have called your two
Aſſiſtants to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and examined their ſeverall Notes, and added them
together, if then you ſhall finde the ſumme of your <hi>firſt
aſſiſtants</hi> Note to be greater then the Summe of your <hi>ſecond
aſſiſtants</hi> Note, that then it is impoſſible to bring the water
from that Spring head to the intended place: but if the Summes of the Notes of
your two Aſſiſtants do exactly agree; there is then a poſſibility of
effecting it, if the diſtance be but ſhort, though with more charge and
difficulty.</p>
                  <p>¶ Note 2, That the moſt approved Authors concerning
this particular do aver, that at every miles end there ought to be alowed
4½ Inches more then the ſtreight Levell, for the current of the
water.</p>
                  <p>¶ Note 3, If there be any Hill lying in the way between
the Spring head and the place to which the water is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed, you muſt
then cut a Trench by the ſide of the Hill in which you muſt lay your pipes
equall with the ſtreight water levell, with the former allowance. And in
caſe there be a Valley you muſt then make a Trunk of ſtrong wood well
under-proped with ſtrong pieces of Timber, and well pitched or leaded, as is
done in diverſe places between <hi>Ware</hi> and <hi>London.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>¶ Note 4, That in your conveying of water to an appointed
place, it is not convenient to bring it from the Spring head by the neereſt
diſtance or in a ſtreight line, but by a crooked or winding way; and you
ought alſo to lay the pipes one up and another down, but this is to be
obſerved but in ſome caſes only, where the water will have too violent a
current.</p>

                  <p>There is another way whereby you may know whether water will
be brought to any place or not, which in very large diſtances ought 
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:60174:106"/> to be conſidered. Take the diſtance between the
Spring head and the place to which the water is to be brought, which multiply
in it ſelfe, adde the product thereof to the Square of the Earths
Semidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ameter, <hi>viz.</hi> to the ſquare of 3436 4/11 Italian miles, then
out of the product thereof extract the Square Root, and then from that Square
Root take 3436 4/11 miles, the remainder is the difference between the line of
levell, and the water or circular levell.</p>

            <p>Thus have I finiſhed my intended diſcourſe of Surveying of
Land, in which I have ſtudied rather to make every particular therein
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained plain and perſpicuous to the meaneſt capacity, then with too
much brevity to obſcure that which I chiefely aimed at, namely, to inſtruct
the ignorant: I confeſſe I may be juſtly blamed by thoſe who are
Maſters of the Art, or have a conſiderable knowledge there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of already, for
uſing too many circumlocutions, but I anſwer, it was not written for their
ſakes, yet I hope it will not be rejected by them; and although I do not
attempt to teach ſuch more then they know already, yet (poſſibly) they
may herein finde ſomthing worth their peruſall and practiſe, or (at
leaſt) it may be a remembrancer unto them to bring to minde what otherwiſe
they may have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten: But ceaſing to apologiſe any more for my Book,
let it now ſpeak for it ſelfe.</p>
